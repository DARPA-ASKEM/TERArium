# TERArium Keycloak Theme
The basis of this CSS was built around the classes/ids of Keycloak's base theme. 

If new features are added to the login page there may be some instances where you should make some divs more or less visible.

## Building
If any changes are made to the theme the Docker image needs to be rebuild by using 
`sh
./build.sh
`

>Make sure that you update the version number.

Once build make sure that it is pushed to the appropriate repository.
